## Simple C++ Calculator

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The program is a simple command-line calculator written in C++. It prompts the user to input two numbers and then select an arithmetic operation to perform. The goal is to introduce basic C++ concepts like input/output, switch-case statements, and error checking.

### What did you do particularly well?
The code handles the division by zero scenario gracefully, avoiding potential runtime errors and informing the user of the mistake.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- The code could be enhanced by implementing functions for each arithmetic operation to modularize the code better.
- Error checking could be expanded to handle non-numeric inputs.
- Adding a loop to allow continuous calculations until the user decides to exit would make the application more user-friendly.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
While the code is relatively simple, handling the division by zero scenario required some thought. To ensure this was handled correctly, referencing C++ documentation helped clarify the best approach. For more complex issues in the future, debugging tools and online forums like StackOverflow will be invaluable.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The basics of user input and output, error checking, and the use of switch-case statements are foundational C++ concepts that will apply to a wide range of future projects and courses.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code is organized with clear prompts and comments for understanding. By keeping the logic straightforward and separated based on functionality, it becomes easier to make changes or extensions in the future. Modularizing operations into separate functions, as suggested earlier, would further improve adaptability.
